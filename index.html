        <!-- Music Section -->
        <section id="one" class="content">
            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>
                Music has always been a large part of my life. From trumpet to bass to synthesizers,
                manipulating sound is a fantastic experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to be obsessed with effect pedals, at one time having about 16 effect pedals being circulated
                from my pedal board.
            </p>
            <p>
                I try to keep a wide taste of music though I’ve noticed a tendency to list to jazz-influenced artists.
                Favorite artists include: Hiatus Kaiyote, Sampha, Flying Lotus, Thundercat, Kamasi Washington,
                City and Colour, and Frank Ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve recently picked up playing acoustic guitar which has been a fun experience!
            </p>

        <!-- Travel Section -->
        <section id="two" class="content">
            <h1>Traveling</h1>
            <p>
                While I’ve been to many countries, I have not been to enough.
                From Amsterdam to Canada and now adding Thailand to the list in April.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s something about immersing one’s self with a foreign culture.
                It forces new ways of thinking, if allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not to mention, the variety of food. There’s just…. So much good food to enough in life.
            </p>

        <!-- Book Section -->
        <section id="three" class="content">
            <h1>Books books books!</h1>
            <p>
                I’ve either got my nose glued to a computer screen or a book. Sometimes both.
                There’s just so much knowledge to absorb and not enough hours of the day.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my favorite books include:</p>
            <p id="book-list">
                Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman,
                Maps of Meaning by Jordan Peterson,
                Race Work & Leadership by Laura Morgan Roberts, Anthony J. Mayo, and David A. Thomas, and
                Thinking in Systems by Donelle H. Meadows.
